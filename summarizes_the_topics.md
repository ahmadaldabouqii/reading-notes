There's a tool which name is **(Git)**, and this tool allow developer's to collaborate in one project, but each one has a copy but in the end it compiles to one unified copy(it's the same code).
So such kind of tool this called "Version control systems", this tool allows developer's to work in the same code base(code base is the code itself but this is the term that we use in the industry).

**How the manager will know who did this?**

    So this is the first thing that version control systems allows us to do, is to keep track of changes, it will tell you what change happen and who did change.
    and then mohammad comes again, and then he changes again!
    the version control systems will again get a new version and indicates that this changes done by Mohammad.

**So the version control systems allow us to do:**

    1- track version(track changes).   2- and to work togather on same projects.    3- and also it allows us to know who did change.

**the tracking happens local, what do you mean about local?**

    local means my device or your device (Your local device), So #Git gives me ability to track these changes on my local device.

**what do we call the devices that are place somewhere else?**

    remote or the cloud (the cloud is devices or data or codes or files placed in somewhere else and it's access from anywhere).

aya done her changes locally, she want to share it with a remote, there should be a remote place that this code that she have done should be share for everyone with me as the second developer and i did my changes.
there's something called #Github it's a web app or website where it gathers or gives you the ability to manage all the remote work on the cloud and distribute the shared files with everyone.
