1. **Input**: is often sent to the computer from a device such as a keyboard, mouse, or other input device. Putting it simple, input is the act of entering data into a computer.

2. **Storage** : all thess different inputes gives a computer an information which is stored in memory.

3. **Processing**: the data is processes through algorithims which is a series of commands that manipulate the input to perform the required task and then sent back to the memory.

4. **Output**: Any information that is processed by and sent out from a computer or other electronic device is considered output. An example of output is anything viewed on your computer monitor screen, such as the words you type on your keyboard. Without some type of output that a human could see, feel, or hear a human could not interact with the computer.
